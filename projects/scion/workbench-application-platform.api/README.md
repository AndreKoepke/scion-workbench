SCION Workbench Application Platform
====================================

SCION Workbench Application Platform - API
------------------------------------------

SCION Workbench Application Platform is an extension of SCION Workbench to integrate content from multiple web applications in a coherent way, thus enabling a micro frontend architecture for allowing different front-end frameworks to co-exist and independent delivery.

The platform provides the mechanics for client-side web application integration. Any web application can be integrated. If the site does not interact with the platform, there is no need for adaptation. For a deeper integration, the platform provides a framework-agnostic guest API.

This package contains data transfer objects to pass data between the platform and the application.

The sources for this package are in [SCION Workbench](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/scion-workbench) repo. Please file issues and pull requests against that repo.
